The AI engineer successfully built an AI WhatsApp assistant for the Feelori brand, progressing from initial setup to a production-ready v2.0 state. The initial phase focused on core AI, WhatsApp, and Shopify integrations, creating a basic FastAPI backend and React frontend. After user feedback, a significant effort was made to enhance security, performance, and code quality across both backend and frontend, including API key authentication, rate limiting, structured logging, and robust error handling. Most recently, the engineer initiated a major frontend modernization, migrating from Create React App to Vite, converting to TypeScript, and implementing brand-specific styling. The project is currently in the final stages of this frontend overhaul, with dependencies resolved and core UI components regenerated.

<product_requirements>
The primary objective is to develop a robust, production-ready AI WhatsApp assistant for the Feelori Shopify brand (feelori.com). This assistant should intelligently chat with customers, provide product recommendations from Shopify, facilitate order tracking, answer FAQs, explain policies, and offer general customer support. It must utilize a dual AI system (Gemini as primary, OpenAI as fallback) for resilience. The solution requires integration with Shopify's Admin API and the official WhatsApp Business API. An admin dashboard is needed for monitoring real-time analytics, conversations, product management, and test messaging. The application should have a modern, professional UI/UX, adhering to specific design guidelines including the Feelori brand color (). Security, scalability, and maintainability are critical for production deployment.

</key_technical_concepts>

<code_architecture>
The application follows a standard full-stack architecture with a FastAPI backend and a React frontend, leveraging MongoDB for data persistence.



-   ****: This is the core of the backend. It started as a basic FastAPI app with health checks, WhatsApp webhook, Shopify product/order fetching, and AI response generation. It was extensively modified to include API key authentication, rate limiting, structured logging, proper environment variable loading (), and robust input validation using Pydantic models. AI models are now initialized at startup for performance.
-   ****: Stores sensitive API keys (Shopify, WhatsApp, Gemini, OpenAI) and the  for backend authentication.
-   ** (previously )**: The main React component. Initially a basic dashboard, it has undergone a complete rewrite to TypeScript () as part of the Vite migration. It now orchestrates the application layout and routes to different dashboard tabs.
-   ****: This new file configures Vite, replacing the Create React App build system, enabling faster development and optimized production builds.
-   ****: Defines TypeScript compiler options for the frontend, crucial for enabling type-checking and successful migration from JavaScript.
-   ****: Configures Tailwind CSS. It was updated to integrate the custom  brand color () for consistent theming across the application.
-   ****: This directory contains reusable UI components based on Shadcn/UI and Radix UI. Many components (e.g., , , , ) were created or updated to be compatible with the new TypeScript and Vite setup, providing a modern and accessible UI.
-   ****: New components for organizing the admin dashboard content into distinct tabs (Dashboard, Products, Analytics, Settings, TestMessage), improving UI structure and navigability.
-   ****: A new file added to the backend for comprehensive API testing, specifically verifying authentication, rate limiting, and the functionality of core endpoints after security improvements.

<current_work>
The AI engineer is currently in the final stages of a comprehensive frontend modernization initiative. This major update involves migrating the React application from Create React App (CRA) to Vite, completely converting the codebase to TypeScript, and overhauling the UI to adhere to specific design guidelines, including the feelori brand color ().

Significant progress has been made:
-   The build system has been transitioned to Vite with  and  in place.
-   The main application component () and entry point () have been rewritten in TypeScript.
-   The  has been updated to include the custom brand color.
-   New UI components for the admin dashboard tabs (, , , , ) have been created, along with shared layout components (, , ).
-   Necessary tooling configurations like , , and  have been generated for production readiness.
-   Crucially, the engineer successfully resolved a yarn install v1.22.22
